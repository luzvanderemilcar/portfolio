# 👋 Hi, I'm Luzvander EMILCAR!

Welcome to my web developer portfolio !

## 🆔️ About

I started developing this portfolio as part of my final project as I was learning web development with the D-Clic team of the OIF (Organisation International de la Francophonie, in French). I was in the beginner session of February 2025.

It's based on a wireframe that was given to the students. So, we were asked to write all the code in order to transform the visual design into functional website.

I've added other functionalities over time, like active section highlight on navigation bar, 


## ✏ Modification notices 

To modify this portfolio, there is some rules to follow in other to respect the consistency of the design.

### ➕ Adding elements 

- **Adding new section** : if the section will have a link to it on the navigation, or elsewhere in the document, it should be given an id for reference and the class of *internal-target* to work properly.

- **Adding navigation link** : all the links of the navigation bar are parts of an ul elements. So, they are *li* items that nest a link *a* element. The *a* should be given the classes *internal-link* and *navbar-link*, and an href attribute that references the targeted element. If it's just a link that is not on the navigation bar, only the class internal-link is required.

### 🗑 Removing element

Just as for adding elements, removing elements requires doing the opposite operation when adding these elements.
